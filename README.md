# Super Mario Odyssey: Online Server

The official server for the [Super Mario Odyssey: Online](https://github.com/CraftyBoss/SuperMarioOdysseyOnline) mod.


## Windows Setup
1. Download latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/Sanae6/SmoOnlineServer/releases)
2. Run `Server.exe`
3. `settings.json` is autogenerated in step 2, modify it however you'd like.

## Building (Mac/Linux Setup)

Must have the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and Git installed.
Run these commands in your shell:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sanae6/SmoOnlineServer
cd SmoOnlineServer
# replace run with build to only build the server
dotnet run --project Server/Server.csproj -c Release
```
If you ran `dotnet build` instead of `dotnet run`, you can find the binary at `Server/bin/net6.0/Release/Server.exe`

## Running under systemd

If you have systemd, you can use the existing systemd serivce.
```
1. cp smo.serivce /etc/systemd/system/smo.service
2. edit ExecStart to your path for the server executable
3. chmod +x filepath to the server executable
4. systemctl enable --now smo.service
```

## Commands

Run `help` to get what commands are available in the server console.
Run the `loadsettings` command in the console to update the settings without restarting.
Server address and port will require a server restart, but everything else should update when you run `loadsettings`.

[//]: # (TODO: Document all commands, possibly rename them too.)
